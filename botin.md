Botín
======

Good evening to everyone at the euromoney award diner in London tonight, I am Emilio Botín, chairman of Banco Santander.

If you are here tonight it is because you are a winner and I'm sure that your award is very well deserved, 
congratulations.

I would like to thank the editors of euromoney, not just for the awards that they've given to Santander tonight, 
but also for producing every month a magasine that tells the world's financial community how we are doing and what 
would do better.

I am of course very pleased and very proud of the awards for Santander this evening.

I would also like to say a few words to the London financial community gathered here tonight.

As you know, Santander is one of the few banks to have successfully come through the turbulences of last year,
unaltered by toxic instruments. You may ask how it's possible.

Well, let me tell you: 
* if you don't fully understand an instrument, don't buy it; 
* if you would not buy for yourself a specific product, don't try to sell it;
* if you don't know very well your customer, don't lend them any money.

If you do all these three things, you will be a better banker, my son.

Lastly, I want to congratulate Banco Santander teams that are here tonight - - - all our units around the world,
and especially from Abbey, a first-line winner; you can also be very proud of what we have done, we are the best
bank in the world.

Thank you and good night.
