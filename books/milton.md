Milton Friedman's Quotes
======

The only way that has even been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together
voluntarily is through the free market. And that's why it's so essential to preserving
individual freedom.

The government solution to a problem is as bad as the problem.

Inflation is taxation without legislation.

Many people want the government to protect the consumer.
A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.

We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes non-work.

Underlying most arguments against free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.

Most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie,
that one party can gain only at the experience of another.

A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither.
A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.

One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions
rather than their results.

The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people
are, it does not care what their religion is, it only cares whether they can produce
something you want to buy.
It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another
to deal with one another and help one another.

Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.

Government has three primary functions.
* It should provide for military defense of a nation.
* It should enforce contracts between individuals.
* It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their properties.
When government —in pursuit of good intention tries to rearrange the economy,
legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost comes in inefficiency,
lack of motivation, and loss of freedom.
Government should be a referee, not an active player.

When unions get higher wages for their members by restricting entry into occupation,
those higher wages are at the expense of other workers who find their opportunities
reduced.
» When government pays its employees higher wages, those higher wages are at
the expense of the taxpayer.
But when workers get higher wages and better working conditions through the free market,
when they get raises by firms competing with one another for the best workers,
by workers competing with one another for the best jobs, the higher wages are
at nobody's expense. They can only come from higher productivity, greater capital
investment, more widely diffused skills. The whole pie is bigger.---there's more for
the worker, but there's also more for the employer, the investor, the consumer, and even
the tax collector.
That's the way the free market system distributes the fruits of economic progress among
all people. That's the secret of the enormous improvements in the conditions of the
working person over the past two centuries.
